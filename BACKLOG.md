### Ticket Details

#### S2-1 Integrate React Query Provider

Add QueryClient + provider in root layout, default retry=1, staleTime config placeholder.
Acceptance: Provider present; existing screens render unchanged; tests still pass.

#### S2-2 Async Route Service Abstraction

Create `services/routeService.ts` exposing `fetchRoutes(params): Promise<Route[]>` (mock delay + deterministic data).
Acceptance: Unit test covers resolution & shape; error path returns empty & logs warning.

#### S2-3 Refactor findRoutes

Replace inline generation with service call; add caching via react-query (`useQuery(['routes', originId, destId, mode, options])`).
Acceptance: Re-renders with same params uses cached data (tested by mock call count =1).

#### S2-4 Virtualize Route List

Replace map over routes with FlatList; keyExtractor route.id; memoized item renderer.
Acceptance: No performance regression; test ensures list renders correct count.

#### S2-5 Virtualize Favorites

Apply FlatList to favorites UI (if not yet); guard empty state.
Acceptance: Snapshot / item count test.

#### S2-6 Toast Focus Announcements

Add utility to shift accessibility focus + optional spoken message when toast appears.
Acceptance: Accessibility test: element with toast label accessible within timeframe.

#### S2-7 Touch Target Audit

Ensure interactive components min 48x48 or hitSlop extending area; document exceptions.
Acceptance: Automated check script (sizes inspected) or manual list in docs.

#### S2-8 Performance Marks

Utility to record `performance.now()` timestamps: route query start/end, first route paint.
Acceptance: Log entries visible in dev mode; simple test asserts mark function no-ops in prod env variable.

#### S2-9 Route Cache Test & Metrics

Add jest test verifying second hook call doesn’t refetch; optional metric aggregator counts fetches.
Acceptance: Expect mock fetch call count stable across re-renders.

#### S2-10 Architecture Doc Expansion

Add sections: Data Fetch Lifecycle, Cache Strategy, Accessibility Utilities.
Acceptance: PR diff shows added headings + content.

#### S2-11 Pre-commit Hooks

Add Husky + lint-staged: run eslint, typecheck (incremental), jest --bail on changed tests.
Acceptance: Commit blocked on failing lint/test.

#### S2-12 CI Optimization

Implement jest worker tuning, coverage thresholds (>=80% lines), optional node_modules caching scaffold.
Acceptance: Local `npm test -- --coverage` meets thresholds; config committed.

| S3-T3 | Jest Selective Suite Tagging | Low | S | Testing | Planned |

### Sprint 3 Ticket Details (Summary)

#### S3-1 Dark Mode & High Contrast Tokens

System theme detection + manual toggle; semantic tokens with WCAG AA contrast; snapshot tests & contrast check script.

#### S3-2 Offline Route Cache Persistence

Persist React Query cache to AsyncStorage with versioning; rehydrate without refetch; tests for hydrate path & fetchCount stability.

#### S3-3 Voice Navigation Progressive Announcements

Announce next direction with distance thresholds; mute toggle; respects screen reader state.

#### S3-4 Accessibility Announce API Unification

Single `announce(message, { politeness })` with web live region; deprecate legacy helper; dedupe & debounce.

#### S3-5 Invariant / Error Telemetry Bridge

`reportError(error, context)` pluggable sink; integrate in boundaries & service catches.

#### S3-6 Route Prefetch Heuristic

Prefetch likely alternate routes / modes post selection (limited concurrency + metrics).

#### S3-7 Dependency & License Audit CI Step

Classify & allowlist licenses; fail on disallowed types.

#### S3-8 Performance Budget Guard

Baseline size snapshot + fail build on >10% growth (warn first iteration).

#### S3-9 Safety Event Streaming Stub

Mock WebSocket emitting safety events with reconnect backoff.

#### S3-T1/T2/T3 Technical Debt

Cleanup and test utility consolidation plus suite tagging to reduce runtime.

## Icebox / Explore

| ID | Idea | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| X-1 | Semantic Accessibility Mapping Layer | Abstract cross-platform roles -> internal map. |
| X-2 | Performance Flame Chart Recorder | Possibly integrate React Profiler API gating. |
| X-3 | Predictive Arrival ML Stub | Requires data collection + privacy review. |
| X-4 | Local Anomaly Detection for Safety Zones | Might leverage distance variance stats. |

## Label Legend

- Priority: High (user value / risk), Medium, Low
- Effort: S (<1 day), M (1–2 days), L (multi-day / cross-cutting)
- Theme: Performance & Data, Accessibility, Tooling, Docs, Testing, Safety, Engagement, Developer UX

## Dependencies & Ordering Notes

- S2-1 precedes S2-3 & S2-9.
- S2-2 precedes S2-3.
- S2-4 benefits from S2-3 (stable data source) but can proceed in parallel.
- Accessibility tasks independent of data layer changes.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

A ticket is Ready when:

- Clear acceptance criteria
- No ambiguous external dependencies OR they’re documented
- Test strategy identified

## Definition of Done (DoD)

- Code + tests merged green
- Docs updated if public API/state shape changes
- No lint/type errors
- Added/updated test coverage for new logic
