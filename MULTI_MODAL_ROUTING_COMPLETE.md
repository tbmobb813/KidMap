 * and safe zone alerts, providing comprehensive transportation planning capabilities
 * designed specifically for children's safety and independence.
 * 
 * USAGE EXAMPLE:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import { RouteIntegration } from './components/RouteIntegration';
 * 
 * // In your main screen component:
 * <RouteIntegration
 *   from={[40.7128, -74.0060]} // NYC coordinates
 *   to={[40.7589, -73.9851]}
 *   fromAddress="Times Square"
 *   toAddress="Central Park"
 *   childAge={10}
 *   parentSupervision={true}
 *   onRouteSelected={(route) => {
 *     console.log('Selected route:', route);
 *     // Start navigation with selected route
 *   }}
 * />
 * ```
 * 
 * This comprehensive system provides everything needed for safe, age-appropriate,
 * multi-modal transportation planning for children and families! üöÄ
