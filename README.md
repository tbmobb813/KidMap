Let me start by saying the reason for the creation of this application is my son, who I love and adore. I want to build a kid-friendly navigation app that simplifies Google Maps functionality while adding subway/train navigation features. The app should be intuitive for children under 16 to use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20 LTS or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Expo CLI (installed via npm)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tbmobb813/KidMap.git
cd KidMap
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

4. For web development
```bash
npm run start-web
```

### Available Scripts
- `npm start` - Start the Expo development server
- `npm run start-web` - Start the web development server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm test` - Run Jest tests

## 📱 Key Features
1. Simple, colorful UI with large buttons and clear visuals
2. Easy destination search with kid-friendly categories (school, park, home, etc.)
3. Public transit focus with subway/train route planning
4. Real-time transit tracking
5. Simplified directions with visual cues
6. Safety features like preset destinations and simple interface

Design approach:
- Light theme with 1-2 pastel primary colors (blue/green)
- Large, clear typography
- Simplified map view with important landmarks highlighted
- Intuitive navigation flow
- Visual indicators for transit options

Let's structure the app with:
- Home screen with big search and favorites
- Map view with simplified controls
- Transit planner with visual route display
- Settings for parents/guardians

For the tech implementation:
- Use expo-location for getting user location
- Create a simplified map interface
- Build transit data integration
- Design kid-friendly UI components
