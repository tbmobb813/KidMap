# Sprint 2 Closeout Report

Date: 2025-08-12
Branch: development
Scope Label: "Data Layer, Performance Instrumentation & A11y Enhancements"

## 1. Executive Summary

Sprint 2 delivered the data caching layer (React Query), async route service abstraction, list virtualization, accessibility improvements (toast announcements + touch target audit), performance instrumentation (marks & metrics), documentation expansion, and CI + pre-commit automation. All committed scope (S2-1 through S2-12) finished; stretch dark mode work intentionally deferred to Sprint 3. Test suite remains green with new metrics and instrumentation coverage. The project is now positioned to add offline persistence, theming, and richer accessibility/voice navigation in Sprint 3.

## 2. Objectives vs Outcomes

| Objective | Delivered Outcome | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Introduce React Query provider | QueryClient in root layout | Done |
| Async route service abstraction | `routeService.fetchRoutes` with metrics | Done |
| Refactor to cached data hook | `useRoutesQuery` replaces inline generation | Done |
| Virtualize route list | FlatList + memoized item | Done |
| Virtualize favorites list | FlatList applied & tested | Done |
| Toast focus & announcements | A11y announce + role=alert + focus attempt | Done |
| Minimum touch target audit | 48px audit utility + component updates | Done |
| Performance marks (fetch + paint) | mark/measure utility & tests | Done |
| Cache reuse test & metrics | fetchCount metrics + tests | Done |
| Architecture doc expansion | Data lifecycle, cache strategy, a11y utilities | Done |
| Pre-commit hooks | Husky + lint-staged + typecheck gate | Done |
| CI optimization & coverage threshold | Workflow (lint, type, tests, coverage, Danger, audit) | Done |

## 3. Key Deliverables

- Data & Caching: React Query integration with composite keys and metrics (fetchCount) verifying cache hits.
- Virtualization: Route list & favorites migrated to FlatList reducing memory/render cost.
- Accessibility: Announce utility integration in Toast; touch target audit raising interactive surface baseline.
- Performance Instrumentation: Custom performance marks capturing fetch durations, first paint, and cache hit/miss events.
- Metrics Testing: Added tests ensuring cache prevents redundant fetches and marks behave as expected.
- Tooling & CI: Husky pre-commit (lint/type) and GitHub Actions CI with coverage thresholds & dependency audit.
- Documentation: Architecture enhancements detailing fetch lifecycle, cache strategy, a11y utilities, performance instrumentation.

## 4. Quality & Metrics

| Area | Indicator | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| Tests | Jest suite | 100% passing |
| Types | TypeScript strict | No errors |
| Lint | ESLint | Clean (0 max warnings) |
| Coverage | Threshold (global lines >=80%) | Enforced in CI |
| Performance Marks | Fetch/paint marks present in dev/test | Verified via tests |
| Accessibility | Touch target & toast a11y tests | Passing |

## 5. Risks & Deferred Items

| Item | Rationale | Defer To |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Dark mode / contrast tokens | Lower immediate functional impact | Sprint 3 (S3-1) |
| Offline cache persistence | Needed after stable instrumentation baseline | Sprint 3 (S3-2) |
| Announce API unification | Would have overlapped active toast changes | Sprint 3 (S3-4) |
| Voice navigation progressive announcements | Dependent on announce unification | Sprint 3 (S3-3) |
| Route prefetch heuristic | Needs baseline fetch metrics first | Sprint 3 (S3-6) |
| Telemetry bridge | Easier after instrumentation patterns established | Sprint 3 (S3-5) |

## 6. Technical Highlights

- Composite Query Keys: Granular caching keyed by travel & accessibility options guarding cross-configuration contamination.
- Metrics Exposure: Lightweight fetchCount aiding deterministic cache behavior assertions.
- Performance Mark Abstraction: Environment-gated instrumentation enabling zero-cost production builds.
- Accessibility Audit Utility: Centralized size auditing encourages consistent interactive affordances.
- CI Streamlining: Single workflow handling lint, type, test, coverage upload, and PR quality (Danger) with concurrency cancellation.

## 7. Lessons Learned

| Observation | Adjustment |
|-------------|-----------|
| Early metrics surfaced duplicate fetch issue quickly | Continue instrument-first approach for new data surfaces |
| Accessibility improvements easier when utilities centralized | Unify announce pipeline before adding complex voice features |
| Virtualization introduced minimal friction post data layer refactor | Preserve separation of data retrieval & presentation for future lists |
| CI optimization late still smooth due to clean scripts | Maintain script simplicity to enable layering additional gates |

## 8. Definition of Done Review

All Sprint 2 DoD criteria met: code merged, tests green, docs updated, thresholds enforced, no outstanding defects flagged.

## 9. Entry Criteria for Sprint 3

| Criterion | Met? | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Stable caching & metrics foundation | Yes | Ready for persistence & prefetch |
| A11y baseline with announcer utility | Yes | Ready to unify announce APIs |
| CI automation & coverage thresholds | Yes | Supports iterative additions |
| Architecture doc updated | Yes | Will append persistence & announce v2 sections |
| No blocking carry-over items | Yes | Stretch items deferred intentionally |

## 10. Sprint 3 Initial Focus (Confirmed)

1. Announce API unification (S3-4) to minimize churn later.
2. Dark mode & contrast tokens (S3-1).
3. Offline query persistence (S3-2).
4. Voice navigation incremental announcements (S3-3).
5. Telemetry bridge for invariant/error reporting (S3-5).
6. Route prefetch heuristic (S3-6).

## 11. Sign-Off

Sprint 2 scope fully delivered; proceeding to Sprint 3 planning & implementation.

Owner Approval: (pending)
