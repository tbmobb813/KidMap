# Mergeable duplicates preserved for manual review

Files moved here were classified `mergeable` by the automated dedupe tool because they
contained additional tests or variations not present in the canonical test files.

Next steps for a maintainer:

- Open each file below, review unique assertions, and merge the important cases into the canonical test under `_tests_/core/` or `_tests_/components/` as appropriate.
- Once merged, delete this file. If you prefer, move the archived file into `_tests_/duplicates/merged/` after merging.

Files in this folder:

- components__AIJourneyCompanion.basic.test.tsx
- components__AIJourneyCompanion.fixed.test.tsx
- components__AIJourneyCompanion.simplified.test.tsx
- components__OnboardingFlow.test.tsx
- components__routeCard.test.orig.tsx
- components__routeCard.test.tsx
- misc__AIJourneyCompanion.simplified.test.tsx
- telemetry.test.tsx

Suggested merge checklist per file (manual):

- Identify unique `it` blocks not present in canonical test.
- Copy those `it` blocks into the canonical file with descriptive comments.
- Adjust imports to match the canonical fileâ€™s relative paths (use `@/` aliases when possible).
- Run `npm run test:core` and `npm run test:critical` after merging.
