TODO: Merge unique assertions from `components__AIJourneyCompanion.basic.test.tsx` into canonical `_tests_/components/AIJourneyCompanion.test.tsx`

Notes:

- This file contains several rendering and error-handling cases that are present in canonical; identify any unique `it` blocks and copy them to canonical.
- Check theme imports (`@/constants/theme`) and icon mocks (`lucide-react-native`) to match canonical.
