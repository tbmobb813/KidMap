# Dependency Audit Process for KidMap

To keep your project secure and up-to-date, follow this process regularly:

## 1. Check for Outdated Packages

- Run `npm outdated` to see which dependencies have newer versions.

## 2. Check for Vulnerabilities

- Run `npm audit` to scan for known security issues.

## 3. Update Dependencies

- For minor/patch updates: `npm update`
- For major updates: Review changelogs and test thoroughly before deploying.

## 4. Automate Checks

- Enable GitHub Dependabot (or similar) for automatic PRs and security alerts.
- Review and merge updates as needed.

## 5. Review Peer Dependencies

- When upgrading React, React Native, or Expo, check all related packages for compatibility.

## 6. Test After Updates

- Run `npm test` and manually test the app after any dependency changes.

Repeat this process monthly or before major releases to ensure a healthy codebase.
